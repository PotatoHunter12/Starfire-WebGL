        <h3>Starfire lore</h3>
        <p>Game is set somewhere in the future and it follows Zhigga, a young astronaut and space ranger, working on a misson to explore other planets. Whilst orbiting an unexplored planet Proluxiraz,
        Zhigga's craft is hit by a small meteorite, resulting in being forced to perform an emergency landing on the planet. While the spacecraft seems to be in a bad condition, Zhigga suffers only minor injuries.
        </p>
        <p>As Zhigga explores around the planet, he finds out why it remained unexplored. With its rough terrain and story weather, Proluxiraz seems to be uninhabitable, even dangerous. Although the gravity seems to be similar to ours 
        and oxygen levels even better, there are hostile beings already vacating this planet. Glowing yellow commets striking any flying object that comes in its orbit make it dificult to land on the planet. 
        And even worse - escape. Every time a comet strikes it leaves small splatters of glowing yellow dust that falls to the ground. Scientists were unable to identify what exactly it is but they know it's destroying any spacecraft 
        humanity sends out there. So they named it Starfire. As Zhigga comes closer to Starfire he feels a strong energy emiting from the dust. And with time, he slowly consumes it. There seems to be no result - untill Zhigga begins to 
        walk around. Suddenly he feels much better, more energised and even... stronger. Like this magic dust gave him some sort of power.
        </p>
        <p>Now freshly energised Zhigga explores the planet even more. While he can't climb the mountains due to his lack of hiking gear he can explore the forests and fields of the planet. He comes upon crashed space vehicles that look like some decades 
        or even centuries old. None of those resemble the one he landed with (if we can call that a landing) so this gives Zhigga a pretty good idea - the planet was never explored because not a single ship ever made it back from the planet. 
        Is this the fate that awaits Zhigga as well?
        </p>
        <p>To make the matters worse, Zhigga gets a visit from the forest. First one creature, then another, then another one... untill he is surrounded. And they don't look friendly. That is confirmed when one of them attacks first. Zhigga has no choice, it's a fight or flight 
        situation. Being surrounded, he opts for the first option.   
        </p>
        <p>Our young astronaut is in good health who undergone an intensive training. He finds this not so difficult after all. With each creature he defeats he becomes stronger, little by little. He can do this after all. And after a while, he notices some big changes...
